# Register Set and Data Types

---

While being in protected mode, the x86 architecture has eight 32--bit general purpose registers \(GPRs\): EAX, EBX, ECX, EDX; EDI, ESI, EBP and ESP. Some of them can be further divided into 8- and 16-bit registers. The instruction pointer is stored in the EIP register.
