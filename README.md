# Introduction to x86's architecture

## Register Set and Data Types

---

While being in protected mode, the x86 architecture has eight 32--bit general purpose registers \(GPRs\): EAX, EBX, ECX, EDX; EDI, ESI, EBP and ESP. Some of them can be further divided into 8- and 16-bit registers. The instruction pointer is stored in the EIP register.

**Table 1.1:** Some GPRs and Their Usage

| REGISTER | PURPOSE |
| :--- | :--- |
| ECX | Counter in loops |
| ESI | Source in string/memory operations |
| EDI | Destination in string/memory operations |
| EBP | Base frame pointer |
| ESP | Stack pointer |

The common data types are as follows:
* **Bytes** - 8 bits. Examples AL, BL, CL
* **Word** - 16 bits. Examples AX, BX, CX
* **Double word** - 32 bits. Examples EAX, EBX, ECX
* **Quad word** - 64 bits. While x86 does not have 64-bit GPRs, it can combine
two registers, usually EDX:EAX , and treat them as 64-bit values in some scenarios.
For example, the RDTSC instruction writes a 64-bit value to EDX:EAX.
